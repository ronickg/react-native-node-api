# `cmake-rn`

A wrapper around Cmake making it easier to produce prebuilt binaries targeting iOS and Android matching the [the prebuilt binary specification](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-node-api/blob/main/docs/PREBUILDS.md).

Serves the same purpose as `cmake-js` does for the Node.js community and could potentially be upstreamed into `cmake-js` eventually.
